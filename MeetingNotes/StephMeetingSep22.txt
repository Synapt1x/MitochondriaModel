- Change each parameter and/or initial condition
	- Does it blow up anywhere? What causes drastic changes
	- Does the behavior match what the biology dictates
		- Follow-up experimentation --> Do changes in
		the model output accurately predict new 
		biological data
- Three things left to finish off:
	- Sensitivity Analysis
	- Qualitative Robustness
	- Finish a copy of the thesis 
		- Aim for end of October-ish
		- In parallel, continue working on publication as well
- Ask Zahra when I meet with her
	- Regulations for examining committee
		 - Can there be overlap between advisory committee and examining?
	- Ask to see a former M.Sc for guidelines and structure
