# Meeting with Steph at St. B - December 29, 2015
## First step -- Model Complex IV
    - Put in introduction
## In Discussion -- Talk about this first step
    - Can discuss next steps and what needs to be improved in model
## Work from complex IV
    - Complexes I - III = Input to complex IV
    - Complex V = Need for proton movement
## Focus on modelling to describe a mechanism
    - Not JUST fitting data
    - Complex IV --> Cannot function alone, thus need inputs from complexes I-III and need complex V controls proton ratio
## Discussion
    - Now that model is working, can then discuss how it can be used and more
    importantly, how this can fit into mitochondrial functioning and be expanded
## Change equations to make sure they're all running ONE TIME
    - Complex IV
    - Check stoichiometric coefficients
## Modelling strategy
    - Mitochondrial functioning
## Figures
    1. Seahorse and Oxygraph in one figure == parts A and B
    2. Figure for the Electron Transport Chain
    3. Complex IV as transfer function (Input -- complex IV -- Output)
    4. Same figure as data + overlayed fit
    5. High/low r
    6. High/low oxygen
    7. Sensitivity Analysis?

## Specify non-negative in ode45 options
    - Re-run for figures

## White backgrounds for all figures

## Re-Plot each boxplot separately

## re-run sensitivity analysis
