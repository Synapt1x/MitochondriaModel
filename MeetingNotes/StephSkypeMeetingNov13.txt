# Create boxplot for each species separately
* Remove outliers
* Change axis scale to show whole boxplots

# Repeat for sensitivity coefficients
* Boxplot for each coefficient
* Group sensitivity coefficients by equation (e.g., oxygen all together)
** so four figures with 9 boxplots on each

# Steps
* Run with higher sampling
