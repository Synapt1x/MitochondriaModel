- Look through the literature for the parameter value ranges
	-- see if there are any major differences
- Sensitivity Analysis
	-- I have the equations
	-- I have the values
	-- Simulate the system and run until it stabilizes (make sure the system converges)
	-- Find the sensitivity coefficient values that converge
		-- Make sure they stabilize
		-- Run the original system and look at the equilibrium (the effect of the parameters on equilibrium)
		-- Store the end value
		-- Run the system for each of the value
	-- Run the system with all values in each row (for all parameters)
		-- Use lhsdesign to create random values
		-- Descriptive statistics for each variable end value
	-- Repeat with the sensitivity analysis coefficients (for all parameters)
		-- same as with the model
	-- For each substrate I will have 9 boxplots
		-- for all the equations I have
