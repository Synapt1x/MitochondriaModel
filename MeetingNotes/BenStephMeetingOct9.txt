# Notes for Meeting with Ben and Steph October 9, 2015



## Things to do
* Make lines thicker (maybe make one dashed)
* Change name of F0 --> names of functions (F_0, should not be used, maybe use
C instead of F)
* Test only with respect to baseline
* Change matlab to have a branch with just baseline
* Have all the cases where:
** Baseline
** Baseline --> drug 1 only
** Baseline --> drug 2 only
** Baseline --> drug 3 only
* Check PLoS computational biology
* Ask Jason about how to cite genetic algorithm
** For thesis AND publication, in both conditions
* Tabulate lists of which poster presentations were Steph's, Jason's, etc.


## Conditions to check
* Add cytochrome c/ remove all cytochrome c
* change pH
* Add oxygen / remove all oxygen
*

## Take the baseline condition
* Do the plots (change pH, no O2, lots of O2, no cyt c, lots of cyt c, etc.)
* Work in progress


## Things to do today
* Baseline condition --> Simulate conditions and save snapshots to github
* Poster
** Table with parameters --> What they represent --> Units
** Separate table with variables --> What they represent --> Units
** Make sure I mention 'perturb the model' when presenting
* Send Stephanie the thesis proposal
* Work on publication
** PloS One -- Check template
