# Thesis
* Not a big deal if I don't grad Jan
* Can submit thesis in December
* Choose quality over rushing the thesis for finishing in October
* Final deadline for everything = January 5 if grad February
* Final deadline for everything = March 5 if grad May

# Sensitivity Analysis
* lhsdesign in matlab
* lb and up = 2 order of magnitude around fit value
* bsxfun to rescale (see matlab example on site)
* Two sensitivity analyses?
* Do the sensitivity analysis on the system W/O F6 (baseline)
* Mathematical sensitivity will require every term (WITH F6)

# Next Work
* Plot baseline behavior over time
* Run for extensive amount of time
* May have singularities: w = T and w = 0
* R = C0
* O = 0
* w = T

# Equilibrium Analysis
* Could rescale and do change of variable
* Can nondimensionalize?
* Quasi-equilbrium -> all left is complex V
* up to complex IV (C I -> C IV) is opposed by complex V at all times
*
