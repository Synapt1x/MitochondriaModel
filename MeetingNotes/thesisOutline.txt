Outline for writing thesis

Intro
- Background of mitochondria function
- Discuss why use mathematical model
- Discuss previous literature on topic

Methods
- Biological techniques
- Mathematical derivation
- Sensitivty analysis of model
- Optimization
- Matlab

Results
- Show biological data
- Show various output from the model
	- Include different iterations of the model (e.g. F0 changes)
- Show the GUI of the model
- Show features of the model functioning
- Sensitivity analysis

Discussion
- Discuss biological data (Why Oxy > Seahorse)
- Discuss the model
	- Show behavior tests
	- Possibly discuss sensitivity analysis
- Discuss assumptions of the model
- Discuss the fallbacks of the model
- Discuss utility of the model

Conclusion
- Restate why mathematical model
- Why is this model useful
	- What is wrong with it an how can it be improved
