#To do

## Update overleaf with texstudio from desktop!

### Compare complex V results to Nath 2000

* Read over Nath 2000 and compare parameter values (compare order)
* Correct p1, p2, p3 to Vmax, K1, Km
* Discuss how rho is multiplied by ATP Synthase
* If you plug in values for proton ratio and p3 ratio then the only real term
in the denominator that matters is p2, since it is much larger, thus the
magnitude difference between p3 and the paper's p3 is negligible
* This will be a big section in the results
* Add table to compare all the parameter values

### Compare parameter results to literature
* Compare each value and see if these values can be found elsewhere
*

### Discussion
* Talk about the good fit, but the methods have some uncertainty with regard
to whether or not these fits are always the best (parameter space limitation)
* Need more work to test the robustness of the model
