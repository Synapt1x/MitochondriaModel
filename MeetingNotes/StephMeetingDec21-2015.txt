# Meeting With Steph Discussing Paper and Thesis
##Trim a lot of the non-informative sentences
	- Not adding information? Then lose it
	- Jam example
## Break Introduction into just three sections
	- Mitochondria --> Why mathematical model --> Previous models
	- Mitochondria
		- ATP Production
		- ETS --> Define five complexes
			- Here put five equations
			- Overall reaction
		- Focus on complex IV
			- Experimental data from complex IV (oxygen)
			- At least calibrate model for complex IV
			- Here talk about data and experiment
			- Discuss the experimental design and the drugs used in experiment
		- No need to discuss chemiosmotic as this will produce more problems
			- "Why didn't you detail this in your model?"
	- Modelling
		- Why? Tool for investigating function
		- Previous models
	- Do introduction last
		
## First naming complexes
	- Itemize

## Order of Writing
	- Methods --> Results and Discussion --> Introduction --> Abstract

## Biological Methods
	- Refer to previous papers using the same protocol
	 
## Section: Derivation Model --> Model
	- First paragraph --> reduce words
	- Always keep same order --> r, o, omega, rho
	- Strategies for modelling
		- Looking at complex IV --> Only data on oxygen is available
		- Each complex is treated as enzymatic
		- Complex IV activation
		- Complex I - III -> input
		- Complex IV cannot be modelled independently --> Complex V will be necessary
			- But don't need to develop, so taken from literature
			- Can put complex V explanation in strategies
		- Keep complex V section
	- First section --> Governing Equations
		- Define parameters of model
		- Complexes I-III output is assumed to be input for complex IV
		- Complexes I-III is referred to as F_0
	- Deriving Activation
		- Need ref
		- where S is substrate, A is activator
		- Recall from assumptions, S is oxygen and A is cyt c reduced.
		- Add explanation for why stoichiometric superscripts are just 1
	- Make sure all functionals are proper (F_0(r,o,omega,rho))
	- Give names to equations
		- 
	- When discussing complex V model
		- Explain the extra rho for correcting units
	- Add c_0 to parameter table
	- In objective function
		- use o(t_i) - x(t_i)
	- Bring back rho and omega testing to methods section instead of results
