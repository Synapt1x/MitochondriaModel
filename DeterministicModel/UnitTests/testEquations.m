    ========================================
    This function houses code for using symbolic variables to represent
    functions in my deterministic model. This function will be essential
    to conducting sensitivity analysis for my mitochondrial model by finding
    the Jacobian of the set of equations in my model. This will be done
    using the symbolic functions for each equation in my model as
    carried out below.
    This will be carrying out sensitivty analysis for the baseline system.
