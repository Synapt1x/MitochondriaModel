Critical Parameter Detection: Mapping a Triangle:
=================================================

This is the same problem that was solved in examples names 'Triangle-X-Niching'
and 'Triangle-F-Niching'.  This example illustrates a capability unique to 
Ferret called "Critical Parameter Detection", or CPD for short.  CPD is designed
to determine which parameters of a problem are actually important to optimizing
the fitness function.
