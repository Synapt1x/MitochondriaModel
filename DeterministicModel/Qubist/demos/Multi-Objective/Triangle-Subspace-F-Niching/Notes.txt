Objective-Space Niching in Two Dimensions: Mapping a Triangle:
=============================================================

This example demonstrates the effect of niching in ***objective space*** on
a multi-objective problem.  The problem is to find the set of points that have
the smallest distance to three distinct points residing in a 2-dimensional
subspace, embedded within a 10-dimensional parameter space.  The optimal 
trade-off surface for this problem is a filled triangle, whose vertices are
the three points.  This can be seen as follows.  If a point is outside of the
triangle, it is always possible to find a point that is simultaneously closer
to all three vertices.  For points inside of the triangle, this is never possible.
In this case, to move closer to one vertex, one must always move further away
from at least one other vertex.

The example named 'Triangle-X-Niching' solves the same problem, except that
niching is done in ***parameter space***.  Both type of niching are effective,
though niching in objective space seems somewhat more effective for this problem.

Reducing the selection pressure is also often useful on multi-objective or class-
finding problems.
