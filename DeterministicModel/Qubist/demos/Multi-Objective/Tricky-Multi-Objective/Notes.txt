Tricky Multi-Objective Problem:
===============================

This is a tricky multi-objective problem with a discontinuous trade-off
surface.  This problem is particularly tricky because the trade-off surface,
as viewed in the F1-F2 projection is divided in two pieces that differ in
their dimensionality.  One part of the trade-off surface is a filled
1-dimensional curve, while the other in a single point.  In cases like this,
the bulk of the optimal set will be found on the curve, at the expense of
the point solution.  This can be problematic if a full exploration near the
point-like solution is required, or if this is the true region of interest.
If this is the case, it is best to change the bounds of the problem to
exclude the line, and concentrate all effort on the point-like solution.
