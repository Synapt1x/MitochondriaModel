Polygon in N-Dimensions:
========================

This is a simple example that illustrates Pareto-optimality by minimizing the
distance to 5 points in an N-dimensional space simultaneously.  The points are
choses randomly in init.m.  Otherwise, this problem is identical to the
Triangle-ND problem.

Note that the problem gets harder as the number of dimensions is increased.
