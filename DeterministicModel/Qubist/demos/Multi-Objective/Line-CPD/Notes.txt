Critical Parameter Detection in Two Dimensions: Mapping a Line:
==================================================================

This example illustrates a capability unique to Ferret called "Critical Parameter Detection",
or CPD for short.  CPD is designed to determine which parameters of a problem are actually
important to optimizing the fitness function.

In this example, we search for the set of points that have the smallest distance 
to two distinct points residing in a 2-dimensional subspace, embedded within 
a 10-dimensional parameter space.  The optimal trade-off surface for this problem 
is a line joining the points.  Therefore, only the parameters corresponding to the
2-dimensional subspace are important.  CPD causes the extraneous eight genes
(parameters) to gradually die out from the population, and may even go extinct.

CPD is controlled by several parameters:
par.CPD.PDeactivateGenes=0; % [0:1]: Probability of gene deactivation.
par.CPD.PReactivateGenes=0; % [0:1]: Probability of gene reactivation.
par.CPD.useTemplates=0; % [0 or 1]: Use templates to replace NaN's in evaluation when possible.
par.CPD.NaN2Random=1; %  [0 or 1, usually 1]: Replace undefined genes (NaN's) with random numbers?

See the demo titled "Triangle-Subspace-CPD" for a more thorough discussion of CPD.
