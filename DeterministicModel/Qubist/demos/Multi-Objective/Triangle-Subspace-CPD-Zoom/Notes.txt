Zoom & Critical Parameter Detection (CPD):
==========================================

This is the same problem that was solved in examples names 'Triangle-X-Niching'
and 'Triangle-F-Niching', except that the triangle now occupies only a tiny
fraction of the parameter space, and Ferret must zoom in to find it.

The point of this demo is to show how CPD and zoom work together.
