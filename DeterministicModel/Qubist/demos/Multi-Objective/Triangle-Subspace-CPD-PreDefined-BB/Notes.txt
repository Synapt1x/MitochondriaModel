Pre-Defined Building Blocks:
============================

This is the same problem that was solved in examples names 'Triangle-X-Niching'
and 'Triangle-F-Niching', except that Linkage Learning is turned on, and a
pre-defined building block is defined.

Ferret is designed to find building blocks, but users are allowed to specify
them if they know how their parameters naturally divide into sub-problems.
This should be done with caution.  An incorrect building block is a recipe for
disaster on a difficult problem.
