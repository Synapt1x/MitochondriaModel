Triangle in N-Dimensions:
========================

This is a simple example that illustrates Pareto-optimality by minimizing the
distance to 3 points in an N-dimensional space simultaneously.  The points are
choses randomly in init.m.  The solution is a filled triangle with the 3 points
at the vertices.

The problem gets harder as the number of dimensions is increased.

NOTE that the maximum number of dimensions is set in init.  If you try to
exceed this value, you will get an error.
