% Ferret Text-Based Setup File
%
% INSTRUCTIONS: Use ***SHORT NAMES*** for all setup field names, following
% the example below.  DO NOT USE THE FULL DOTTED NAMES OF THE FIELDS AS THEY
% APPEAR IN THE MORE COMMON SETUP FILES IMPLEMENTED AS M-FILES.
%
% Note that only a few values are changed here from the default settings.
% THIS IS A VERY BASIC, AND NOT VERY GOOD, SETUP FILE.  IT IS MEANT ONLY TO
% DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNIQUE OF USING TXT FILES INSTEAD OF M-FILES FOR FERRETSETUP.
%
% Users can inclue any valid field here that is normally used in the setup
% file.
%
% *** Note that m-files are the preferred way to specify a setup file.  The
% text file method may be depreciated in the future. ***
