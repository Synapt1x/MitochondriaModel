Text-File Based Setup Files
==================================================================

This demo is the same as the "Triangle-CPD" example EXCEPT that a text file
(FerretSetup.txt) is used for the setup file, rather than the more common m-file.
M-files are the preferred technique, and text-file based setup files may be
depreciated in future releases.

NOTE THAT THE SETUP FILE SPECIFIED HERE IS VERY BASIC AND REALLY NOT VERY GOOD.
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DEMO IS ONLY TO DEMONSTRATE TEXT-FILE BASED SETUP FILES.
