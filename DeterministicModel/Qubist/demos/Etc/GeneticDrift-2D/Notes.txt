Genetic Drift:
=============

A simple example showing the minimization of a function with 2 parameters.
In this example, Ferret functions as a normal GA, without niching or elitism.  

Notice that the solution settles to one minimum at random.  This illustrates
the process of genetic drift, which is the main effect that a multi-objective
genetic algorithm must combat using niching and other diversity-preserving
strategies.

NOTE THAT THE RESULTS ARE INTENTIONALLY POOR IN THIS EXAMPLE TO DEMONSTRATE
GENETIC DRIFT.  THIS IS CORRECTED IN THE EXAMPLE "ISOLATEDNICHES-2D".
