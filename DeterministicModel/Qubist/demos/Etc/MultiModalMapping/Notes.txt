Multi-modal function used to test mapping capabilities when
par.selection.FAbsTol > 0.  This demo is (somewhat) inspired by the
Rastrigin functions in the Published-Test-Problems section of the demos.

Solutions take the form of multiple islands.
This is very difficult to maintain -- lethals generated during crossovers
between islands are expected to be challenging.

Solution is F=0 @ X=[1;1;1;...;1].
