Error Example:
==============

*** This statement generates an intentional error! ***
*** This demo will not run.  It is meant to demonstrate Test Mode. *** 

This is an example of a fitness function with an error.
Try it using both the "normal mode" and the "test mode", which
you can toggle between using a menu item under the "Other" menu.

Test mode is useful because it turns off all error trapping,
allowing the user to see a trace of any errors that are
encountered during the execution of the user's fitness function.
