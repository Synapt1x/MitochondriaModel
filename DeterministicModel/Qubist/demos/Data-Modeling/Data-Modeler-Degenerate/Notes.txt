Modeling Data:
=============

This example shows how Ferret can be used to do multi-parameter fits to data.
The "fakeData.m" program makes a fake, noisy data set, which we try to fit.
The data produced by fakeData.m could be replaced with real data.

SPECIAL TECHNIQUE FOR RESUMING RUNS:

The fake data set is generated randomly, and the the resumed run will be using
entirely different data!  If you want to resume this run, you MUST re-select
the demo and tell Ferret to SKIP loading the init file.  This will cause Ferret
to use the fake data set already encoded in the extPar structure saved with the
previously generated History files.
