Modeling Data:
=============

This example shows how Ferret can be used to do multi-parameter fits to data.
The "fakeData.m" program makes a fake, noisy data set, which we try to fit.
The data produced by fakeData.m could be replaced with real data.

SPECIAL TECHNIQUE FOR USING extPar_ AS A GLOBAL VARIABLE:

This demonstrates the technique of sending extPar_ (the output from the
init function) as a global variable.  This may be useful in unusual
situations like calling SAMOSA or Anvil from *inside* a Ferret fitness
function, since it allows them to use a shared copy of extPar_, thus
decreasing memory usage.  If extPar_ is present as a global variable
after init is caled, the output from init will *not* be included in
par.user.extPar, but *will* be available as global variable extPar_.
Note that when using the global extPar_ technique, extPar (without the
underscore) is still required for fields added by Ferret - most importantly
extPar.status for the parallel computing system.
