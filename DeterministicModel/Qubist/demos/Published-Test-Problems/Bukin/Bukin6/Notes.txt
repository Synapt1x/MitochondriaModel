Solution: F_min(10,1)=0

This is one of the most pathological functions that I have ever seen.
Mishra (2006) offers the following description:

"Bukin?s functions are almost fractal (with fine seesaw edges) in 
the surroundings of their minimal points. Due to this property, they
are extremely difficult to optimize by any method of global (or local)
optimization and find correct values of decision variables"

Ferret does a nice job of mapping the deep valley where the solution
resides with normal, default settings.  A very large value of the niching
acceleration parameter helps with problems like this one:

par.niching.acceleration=10;  (roughly)

because this helps Ferret to search long narrow valleys without
spending too much time dropping points on the valley walls.  This
is a good strategy to employ whenever you see Ferret mapping long,
deep valleys and having trouble obtaining a consistent solution.  Even
so, Ferret has a lot of trouble with this problem and does not solve it
consistently.

Note that none of the optimizers tested by Mishra (2006) could solve
this problem!!!
