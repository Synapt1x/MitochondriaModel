% Bukin's 2nd function.
% 
% Solution: F_min(-10,0)=0
% 
% Bukin's functions are truly pathological.
% Mishra (2006) offers the following description:
% 
% "Bukin's functions are almost fractal (with fine seesaw edges) in 
% the surroundings of their minimal points. Due to this property, they
% are extremely difficult to optimize by any method of global (or local)
% optimization and find correct values of decision variables"
% 
% Ferret does a nice job of mapping the deep valley where the solution
% resides with normal, default settings.  A very large value of the niching
% acceleration parameter helps with problems like this one:
% 
% par.niching.acceleration=10;  (roughly)
% 
% because this helps Ferret to search long narrow valleys without
% spending too much time dropping points on the valley walls.  This
% is a good strategy to employ whenever you see Ferret mapping long,
% deep valleys and having trouble obtaining a consistent solution.  Even
% so, Ferret has a lot of trouble with this problem and does not solve it
% consistently.
