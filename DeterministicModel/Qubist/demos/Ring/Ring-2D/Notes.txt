Diversity-preserving Strategies: Mapping a Ring of Solutions:
============================================================

This example demonstrates how Ferret can map a family of solutions to a
problem with a single objective when the optimal set is a 'valley' filled with
many solutions of the same fitness. 

The solution is a filled oval ring, which must be populated with
solutions.  This is accomplished by setting par.niching.X > 0 (about 0.1 - 0.25)
is usually about right.  Setting the mating restriction to a negative value
causes solutions to crossover preferentially with their neighbours.  This reduces
the number of "lethals" (poor quality solutions) that would arise in the central
part of the oval from parents on opposite sides of the high performance ring.  
Try setting par.XOver.matingRestriction.X to zero or a less negative value (or even
a positive number), and see what happens.  Note that 
-1 <= par.XOver.matingRestriction.X <= 1.

Note that this is an example of a "class-finding" problem that uses the full-blown
machinery of a multi-objective genetic algorithm (niching, etc.) on a problem with
a single objective.  Class-finding problems are characterized by a single objective
function with a flat-bottomed valley where a class of optimal solutions resides.
