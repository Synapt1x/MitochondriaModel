Modifying X from Inside the Fitness Function:
=============================================

This example demonstrates how X can be modified by the user from inside of
the fitness function.  This may be useful for problems that require a constraint
on X that is difficult to code any other way.  For example, one can modify X
so that its values sum to 1, as is done in ths demo.

This is not a commonly used feature and is meant for advanced users.  If it
is possible to re-define parameters so that the constraint is satisfied automatically,
this is usually a better approach.
