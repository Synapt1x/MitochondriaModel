Hard & Soft Boundaries:
=======================

This example is the same as the Ring-2D demo, except that it demonstrates
the use of 'hard' and 'soft' boundaries.  par.zoom.allowZoomOut is turned
on, and all boundaries are declared 'soft' except for one.  Ferret will
zoom out, as required, but will never allow solutions past the hard
boundary.
