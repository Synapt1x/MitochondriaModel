Simple 1-Dimensional Problem:
============================

A simple example showing the minimization of a function with only one variable.
par.selection.FAbsTol=1 to illustrate how the parameter space can be mapped
within an absolute tolerance of 1 or the minimum in F.

An auxOutput field is included fo testing: F(i)=auxOutput{i} in OptimalSolutions if
everything is working correctly.
