Deception in One Dimension:
==========================

A simple example showing the minimization of a function with only one variable.
This is a deceptive function in which the gradient of the function point away
from the high performance region (HPR) at 8 < x < 9 everywhere.  If even a single
individual finds the HPR, the entire population is eventually dragged in.  This
is guaranteed by turning on elitism.  The fraction of the population designated
elite is determined by setting par.elitism.frac > 0.  When elitism is turned 
on, the elites are guaranteed to be preserved intact to the next generation.
This way, once the HPR is found by even one individual, it can never be lost
due to crossovers and mutations in subsequent generations.
