Noisy 1-Dimensional Problem:
===========================

An example showing the minimization of a function with only one variable.
The function has many minima and time-varying noise is added to show noise tolerance.
The black line shows the 'true' fitness without added noise, and the blue line shows an
instantaneous evaluation.  The green vertical line shows the global minimum of the
unperturbed function.
