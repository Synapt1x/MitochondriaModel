A sharp Gaussian spike in an otherwise flat high-dimensional space
==================================================================

This is a difficult problem, where the fitness function is nearly flat
everywhere, except for a single narrow off-centre Gaussian spike.  The
depth of the spike is 1.1, and we try to map out the region up to
F < min(F)+1.  This is difficult because early in the run, before the
spike has been discovered, the entire space meets this criterion.  In
effect, Ferret tries to map the entire space early on, distracting it
from the spike.

This problem becomes much more difficult as the dimensionality increases.
The dimensionality is set in init.m.  How high can we go before the
solution can't be found?
