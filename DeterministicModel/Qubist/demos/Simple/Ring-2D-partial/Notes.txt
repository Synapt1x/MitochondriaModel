Zoom-OUT Feature:
=================

Same as the Ring-2D-Zoom Example, EXCEPT that par.zoom.allowZoomOut=1.
When this control parameter is true (1), Ferret is allowed to violate the initial
boundary conditions and ZOOM OUT to expand beyond its initial bounds.

Parameters may be continuous, discrete, or cyclic.
