Cyclic Parameters in 2 Dimensions:
==================================

This example shows how to set up cyclic parameters using 'par.general.cyclic'.
This control parameter just provides a list of the parameters whose endpoints
are periodic.

The setup file has the matingRestriction parameter turned off, so that many 
'lethals' are formed between the isolated minima.  Crossover takes place
approximately along the shortest of the 2 directions allowed between 2 
solutions in a cyclic parameter.  The search directions are obvious in the
user plot.  Better (though less illustrative) results can be obtained in this
example by setting a negative matingRestriction.X ~ -1.
