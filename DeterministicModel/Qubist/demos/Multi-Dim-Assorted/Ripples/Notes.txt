Periodic Ripples - Finding a Needle in a Haystack:
==================================================

This example is a simple 2-dimensional problem, where the optimal solution
is a single point at the centre of a set of periodic rings.  Every ring (or
ripple) has a fitness value the is almost as good as global solution in the
centre.

This kind of problem is quite difficult and a large population size may be
required to solve it reliably.  If a solution does not land in the the
vicinity of the grobal solution early in the run, Ferret may be "distracted"
by one of the much larger, near-optimal rings.  The only solution to increase
reliability is to increase the population size, so that the early exploration
of the problem has a greater chance of stumblng on the small optimal region.
