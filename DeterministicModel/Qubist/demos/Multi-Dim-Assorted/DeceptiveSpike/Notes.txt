Deceptive Spike:
===============

This is an interesting test, where the goal is to find a sharp
off-centre negative Gaussian spike added to a shallow multi-dimensional
quadratic.  The gradient of the quadratic always points to the origin,
which tries to deceptively lead the solver away from the true solution in
the spike.  This problem becomes MUCH more difficult as the dimensionality
is increased, which can be controlled from the setup function.  How high
can we go?
