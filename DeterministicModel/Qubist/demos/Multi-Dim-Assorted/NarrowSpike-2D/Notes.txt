Isolated Niches:
===============

This is a complicated example showing the effects of extreme mating and competition
restrictions and a fuzzy fitness function on the evolution of a population.  These
parameters must be between -1 and 1.  When they are negative, competition and mating
occurs preferentially between individuals that are relatively nearby in parameter
space.  The net effect is that the population has the ability to break into relatively
independent clusters.  In this example, there are 8 equal global minima in a 2-dimensional
parameter space, which should all be populated as a result of these effects.  Compare 
with example 5, which does not use these advanced features.
