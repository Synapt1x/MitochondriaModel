<!--l. 3079--><p class="noindent" >We close this chapter with some brief comments regarding so-called &#8216;non-parametric&#8217; models, which do not
assume a specific mathematical form for the underlying model. A simple example is given by the demo
&#8216;Advanced/Non-Parametric-Image-Modeling&#8217; which adapts about 600 pixel values of a model image until they agree
with a real image, by minimizing the <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C7;</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup> statistic. The solution is trivial of course, since I could just assign the
actual, known pixel values to the model, but I perform a full <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C7;</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup> minimization to illustrate this class
of problems in general. The term &#8216;non-parametric&#8217; model is somewhat of a misnomer because such
problems often have several hundred parameters, which makes them - from a computational point
of view - the most &#8216;parametric&#8217; of all. They are non-parametric in a mathematical sense that they
do not impose a specific functional form on the solution, as is typical of most other data-modeling
problems.
<!--l. 3081--><p class="noindent" >Non-parametric models may require some special handling to find solutions efficiently. It is important to realize
that such problems have extremely large linkage matrices (600 <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7; </span>600 for the non-parametric image
modeling demo), and as such, there is not much point in trying to find all of the linkages. Therefore, I
normally set the initial linkage to some reasonable value (less than about 0.5) and turn linkage learning
off:
<!--l. 3087--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="colorbox" id="colorbox53"> <div class="minipage"><div class="BVerbatimInput"><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.link.PLink=0;</span><br /><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.link.initialLinkage=0.25;</span></div>
</div></span>
<!--l. 3093--><p class="noindent" >Non-parametric models work best when the parameters are uncorrelated, like the pixels in my demo, so this is really
not a huge restriction.
<!--l. 3095--><p class="noindent" >It is <span 
class="cmti-10">very important </span>to turn off niching acceleration (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse52.html#x78-1100008.9">8.9<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_niching --></a>), and auto-adaptation of this strategy
parameter, for very large non-parametric problems:
<!--l. 3102--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="colorbox" id="colorbox54"> <div class="minipage"><div class="BVerbatimInput"><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.niching.acceleration=0;</span><br /><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.strategy.adapt.niching.acceleration=false;</span></div>
</div></span>
<!--l. 3108--><p class="noindent" >This is necessary for efficiency, since niching acceleration is extremely expensive when the number of parameters is
large. The default setting, with the acceleration turned on, would require much more overhead than it is
worth.
<!--l. 3110--><p class="noindent" >Finally, I have noticed that restricting mutations and crossovers to single building blocks (discovered by linkage
learning) seems to allow Ferret to solve non-parametric problems more rapidly than the defaults settings, where
Ferret chooses automatically whether to restrict crossovers to individual building blocks or do unrestricted
crossovers over all parameters. In effect, building block restriction means that any given mutation or
crossover only involves a single building block, which would include about 25% of the parameters if
<span 
class="cmtt-10">par.link.initialLinkage=0.25</span>, as in the example settings above. Building block restriction is enabled for
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
mutation and crossover by the following lines in the setup file:
<!--l. 3116--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="colorbox" id="colorbox55"> <div class="minipage"><div class="BVerbatimInput"><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.mutation.BBRestricted=true;</span><br /><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.BBRestricted=true;</span></div>
</div></span>
<!--l. 3122--><p class="noindent" >Please refer to Sections <a 
href="QubistHTMLse50.html#x76-1060008.7">8.7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_mutation --></a> and <a 
href="QubistHTMLse51.html#x77-1070008.8">8.8<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_XOver --></a> for additional comments about these settings.
<!--l. 3124--><p class="noindent" >The demo &#8216;Advanced/Non-Parametric-Image-Modeling&#8217; contains a FerretSetup file that you can use as a template
for non-parametric models. There are a few other slightly atypical settings there, such as no auto-adaptation, a
relatively high mutation rate, and a low elite fraction. However, these settings are not as critical as those described
above and you should feel free to modify them to suit your application.
