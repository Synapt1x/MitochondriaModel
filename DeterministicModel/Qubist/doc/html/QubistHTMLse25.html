<!--l. 2567--><p class="noindent" >As Ferret runs, it generates &#8216;History&#8217; files in the project&#8217;s data directory (called &#8216;FerretSetup&#8217; by default), which
contains detailed information about the state of the run at each generation and the solutions that were
considered to be optimal at that generation. The optimal solutions discovered at later generations are
always at least as good, and usually superior to the &#8216;optimals&#8217; recorded in History files from early
generations.
<!--l. 2569--><p class="noindent" >A run can be analyzed after it is stopped, or at any point while it is running. There are several methods for doing
this, but all methods trigger an identical sequence of events that compute the final optimal set of
solutions from your run. Analysis also starts Ferret&#8217;s integrated visualization system, which is designed to
help you to explore your solution set and understand its structure and distribution in the parameter
space.
<a 
 id="dx42-63003"></a>
<!--l. 2572--><p class="noindent" >The easiest way to analyze a run is to click the &#8216;Analyze&#8217; button on the Ferret console window or select &#8216;Analyze
History&#8217; from the &#8216;Control&#8217; menu, as discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse13.html#x27-350004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:demos --></a>. This will bring up Ferret&#8217;s analysis window, as shown
in Figure <a 
href="QubistHTMLse13.html#x27-350147">4.7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:analysis --></a>. Other views of this window are shown in Figure <a 
href="QubistHTMLse32.html#x51-750112">5.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:analysisViews --></a>, which shows the results from a detailed
data-modeling example presented in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse31.html#x50-740005.1">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:binaries --></a>. Analysis also generates an &#8216;OptimalSolutions.mat&#8217; file in the data
directory (<span 
class="cmtt-10">par.history.dataDir</span>), which contains contains all of the final results from your run, including the final
optimal set and other information generated during the analysis of the run. The OptimalSolutions.mat file is
discussed in detail in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse28.html#x46-700004.18">4.18<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:OptimalSolutions_file --></a>.

<!--l. 2575--><p class="noindent" >In addition to the method discussed above, it is also possible to trigger the re-analysis of a run from the analysis
window by pressing the &#8216;Re-Analyze&#8217; button located in the &#8216;Analysis&#8217; window. Re-analysis is usually only necessary
if the &#8216;Fuzziness&#8217; button is used to add or modify a fuzzy tolerance for the generation of the optimal set. Fuzzy
tolerances are discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse36.html#x55-790005.6">5.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:fuzziness --></a>, and the Fuzzy Tolerance interface, which is opened by pressing the Fuzziness
button, is shown in Figure <a 
href="QubistHTMLse36.html#x55-790029">5.9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:setAnalysisTolerances --></a>.

<!--l. 2578--><p class="noindent" >Finally, you should be aware that the Qubist package contains an &#8216;Analyze History Tool&#8217; that can be launched from
the component selector menu when you run launchQubist. This tool is <span 
class="cmti-10">extremely </span>useful, because it enables you to
put off analyzing your runs until you are ready to do so. I most often use this feature when I&#8217;m doing several
similar runs, often over the course of several days, and want to do all of the analysis at the same time
when everything finishes. The Analyze History Tool is discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse95.html#x127-21600012.2">12.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:analyzeHistoryTool --></a> of the &#8216;Other Tools&#8217;
chapter.
