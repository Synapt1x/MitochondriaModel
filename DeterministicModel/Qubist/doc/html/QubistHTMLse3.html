<!--l. 664--><p class="noindent" >Locust is Qubist&#8217;s multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (PSO). Like Ferret, this is a biologically inspired global
optimizer, which searches a parameter space using a swarm of interacting particles. PSOs are often discussed in
terms of the dynamics of flocks of birds, schools of fish, or swarms of social insects searching for food. The
commonality is that intelligent behaviour is an emergent property of the system as a whole, even if the
component parts are modeled as relatively simple automata that interact with each other through simple
rules.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Particle swarm optimizers (PSOs) are a relatively new class of global optimizers that are a topic of intense research.

href="QubistHTMLli1.html#Xeberhart01">2001</a>] provides a good introduction to the PSO technique, along with an interesting discussion of how
human intelligence derives from social interactions. The basic PSO technique is relatively simple, and there are
many other excellent introductions on the web.

<!--l. 670--><p class="noindent" >I began developing Locust in 2007 and it has developed rapidly because many of its internal functions borrow
heavily from Ferret. Of all of the Qubist optimizers, Locust is the one that has undergone the most fundamental
recent developments. I only developed the new Locust-2 code in the summer of 2009, as I wrote the bulk of this
user&#8217;s guide. Locust has surprised me because it is beginning to rival Ferret on tough global optimization problems.
It does this without Ferret&#8217;s linkage learning capabilities, critical parameter detection, strategy parameter
auto-adaptation, or other fancy features. Locust has far, far fewer options than Ferret and is probably the simplest
to configure of all of the Qubist optimizers. This is the most beautiful aspect of the PSO technique - particle
swarm dynamics result in extremely powerful optimizers with relatively little messing around. In some
ways, Locust is the opposite of Ferret. Ferret is a huge, pondering machine that crushes problems by
analyzing their mathematical structure in detail, but Locust is a smaller, snappier code that does much
less analysis internally, and yet has the uncanny ability to perform almost as well as Ferret on many
problems.

<!--l. 673--><p class="noindent" >I see Locust as absolutely complementary to Ferret, and it will be the target of considerable future development.
However, these are still early days for this code - especially the new features in Locust-2. Ferret remains the most
powerful optimizer in the Qubist package and by far the most thoroughly tested. You should definitely try Locust if
you are interested in exploring alternatives, but I recommend Ferret for the toughest and most &#8216;mission-critical&#8217;
applications.

<!--l. 681--><p class="noindent" >Locust is unique as a PSO because it is based on an exact analytical solution to the equations governing the
behaviour of the swarm, which improves the stability of the algorithm. &#8216;Particle explosions&#8217; are a well-known
instability that affects PSOs, in which errors accumulate and particles tend to wander off to infinity.
An exact analytical solution helps to control particle solutions, and they do not occur in the Locust
code.

<!--l. 687--><p class="noindent" >As a multi-objective code, Locust is built with unique features that enable it to map the trade-off surfaces of
multi-objective problems and the optimal solution set of fuzzy single-objective problems. It accomplishes this by
means of a novel algorithm that divides the parameter space into &#8216;neighbourhoods&#8217;, which represent self-contained
&#8216;sub-swarms&#8217; that do not interact with particles outside of the neighbourhood. These neighbourhoods are dynamic;
they move and possibly merge together as the code converges toward the optimal set. Mergers happen quickly for
non-fuzzy problems with only one objective, and all of the neighbourhoods normally merge together so that all
particles focus on the same optimal solution. Fewer mergers occur for parameter space-mapping problems, and the
particle neighbourhoods will tend to spread out on the trade-off surface or within the optimal set. This was in fact
the key innovation that makes the Locust-2 code so much more powerful than the previous Locust-1
code.

<!--l. 690--><p class="noindent" >Locust has all of Ferret&#8217;s features for pausing and resuming runs, as well as access to the same visualization system.
Locust typically uses a different setup file than Ferret, but it can read Ferret&#8217;s setup files and combine this
information with default Locust settings. Moreover, the formats for the initialization, fitness, and custom graphics
functions are identical. This makes it easy to swap optimizers for comparison purposes. Locust is discussed in
