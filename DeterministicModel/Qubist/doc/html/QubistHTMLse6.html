<!--l. 773--><p class="noindent" >SemiGloSS&#x00A0;is an acronym for the <span class="underline">Semi</span>-<span class="underline">Glo</span>bal <span class="underline">S</span>olution <span class="underline">S</span>pray optimizer, which is an experimental
multi-objective solution polisher in the Qubist package. SemiGloSS&#x00A0;moves from point to point through the
parameter space by firing solutions into the space, and keeping track of directions and ranges that have
previously been found to be successful. In this way, SemiGloSS&#x00A0;learns how to move through the space in a
way that increases its chances of finding an improved solution. It contains its own critical parameter
detection system that is modeled on Ferret&#8217;s CPD algorithm, which improves the efficiency of the
code.
<!--l. 775--><p class="noindent" >Although SemiGloSS&#x00A0;is not a true global optimizer, it is quite fast and has significant global properties that allow it
to hop over moderate sized &#8216;mountain ranges&#8217; in the parameter space. Using SemiGloSS&#x00A0;as a stand-alone optimizer
may lead to accurate global solutions with fewer function evaluations than are required using the other Qubist
global optimizers, as long as the problem is not too difficult. However, the price of this performance is that the space
is not explored nearly as thoroughly, and SemiGloSS&#x00A0;offers little assurance that the true global solution
has been found. SemiGloSS&#x00A0;should only be used as a standalone global optimizer for relatively easy
problems that have already been well-characterized by Ferret, Locust, or Anvil. It is better suited
as a polisher for solutions found by Ferret or Locust, since global optimization is not required for
polishing.

<!--l. 778--><p class="noindent" >It is important to realize that SemiGloSS&#x00A0;is experimental, and rarely performs as well as Anvil as a standalone
global optimizer, and never as well as Ferret or Locust.  It is retained by the Qubist package in order to provide an
alternative multi-objectiver polisher to Anvil and SAMOSA, and as a area for future growth of the
package.

<!--l. 784--><p class="noindent" >Like Locust, Anvil, and SAMOSA, SemiGloSS&#x00A0;understands Ferret&#8217;s setup files and fitness functions, and can be set
as the solution polisher by changing a single line of the problem&#8217;s setup file. Once this is done, SemiGloSS&#x00A0;can be
called from either Ferret or Locust by simple pressing the &#8216;Polish&#8217; button on the analysis window
used by Ferret and Locust to display final results. SemiGloSS&#x00A0;remains undocumented in this user&#8217;s
guide due to it&#8217;s experimental nature and the certainty that it will change substantially in future
versions.
