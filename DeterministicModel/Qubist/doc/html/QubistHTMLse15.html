<!--l. 1474--><p class="noindent" >For many runs, it is often best to set the maximum number of generations (<span 
class="cmtt-10">par.general.NGen</span>) to an arbitrarily
high number and just run Ferret until the graphs on the console indicate sufficient convergence. This is especially
true of problems with multiple solutions (nearly all multi-objective problems, and some single-objective problems),
because these problems require an entire region of the parameter space to be mapped. Such problems
often arrive at the optimal region quite rapidly, but the optimization should continue for as many
generations as possible (within reason) in order to map the optimal part of parameter space in detail. For
such problems, the optimal set gets progressively more detailed, and runs are limited by how long the
user is willing to wait, the detail required in the optimal set, and how nice you want your figures to
look.

<!--l. 1477--><p class="noindent" >Stopping a run manually is more qualitative than many people like, but it is fine for problems that focus on
parameter space mapping, because the results don&#8217;t <span 
class="cmti-10">really </span>change once the optimal region has been found - they just
get progressively more detailed. I often compare these types of problems to &#8216;integrating photons&#8217; when observing an
astronomical object with a telescope. The longer you wait, the more detailed and less noisy the image becomes, and
the decision to stop observing is based in part on your image requirements, and in part by how long you are willing
to wait. For this type of problem, just do an analysis now and then to check the quality of the solution set, and
stop the run when you see fit. At this point, just click the &#8216;Stop Ferret&#8217; button on the interface, wait
for Ferret to stop, and do an analysis to obtain your final results. Analysis is discussed in Section

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">
     You
     can
     specify
     stopping
     tolerances
     on
     the
     parameters
     and/or
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     the
     fitness
     values,
     which
     will
     automatically
     terminate
     your
     run
     when
     your
     criteria
     are
     met.
     This
     is
     done
     by
     setting
     <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.stopping.XTol</span>
     and/or
     <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.stopping.FTol</span>
     in
     the
     Ferret
     setup
     file,
     as
     discussed
     in
     Section

     Note,
     however,
     that
     this
     method
     is
     not
     usually
     useful
     for
     parameter
     space
     mapping
     problems,
     because
     they

     You
