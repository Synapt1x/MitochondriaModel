<!--l. 1298--><p class="noindent" >The Ferret console window contains a Demo menu, which is used to select any demo that is to be run. All of the
demos listed are located in subdirectories of the Qubist demo directory: [Qubist_Home]/demos. Each demo is
designed to illustrate a particular feature or set of features, and each is accompanied by a &#8216;Notes.txt&#8217; file that
explains what is being demonstrated. The Notes.txt file is automatically loaded into the Project Info/Notes pane
when the demo is run, and every m-file in the demo directory is human-readable. It is a good idea for new users to
try some of these demos while reading this guide to understand how the initialization, fitness files,
output, and myPlot functions are implemented, as well as the setup options in the FerretSetup.m
file.

<!--l. 1301--><p class="noindent" >It is possible to add your own demos simply by adding a new folder to the demo directory because any folder in this
location is assumed to be a demo. However, this is not the preferred method to add actual projects. Adding projects
is not much more difficult, but it does offer additional flexibility, as discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse14.html#x28-360004.4">4.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:projects --></a>. In practice, the demo
directory is very useful when setting up a new project because it is usually possible to find a demo that is similar in
spirit to the actual problem, so that the demo initialization, setup and fitness files can be used as
templates.
<!--l. 1303--><p class="noindent" >Demos can be run by the following steps:

     You
     may

     a

     like
     the
     one
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     shown
     in
     Figure
     <a 
href="#x27-350125">4.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:WindowFocus --></a>.
     This
     is
     just
     a
     warning
     that
     MATLAB
     sometimes
     has
     rather
     poor
     control
     over
     window
     focus
     because
     user
     interface
     components
     run
     in
     the
     same
     thread
     as
     a
     project&#8217;s
     computation.
     The
     solution
     is
     to
     include
     short
     pauses
     in
     the
     project&#8217;s
     fitness
     function,
     if
     the
     user
     interface
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     seems
     sluggish.
     Occasional
     calls
     to
     <span 
class="cmtt-10">pause(0.001)</span>
     are
     sufficient
     because
     this
     forces
     MATLAB
     to
     check
     the
     event
     queue.
     For
     now,
     just
     click
     OK.
     Note
     that
     there
     is
     a
     little
     box
     on
     this
     window
     that
     you
     can
     click
     if
     you
     don&#8217;t
     want

     this
     message
     again.

     While
     Ferret
     is
     running,
     the
     &#8216;X-Axis&#8217;,
     &#8216;Y-Axis&#8217;,
     and
     &#8216;Z-Axis&#8217;
     menus
     can
     be
     used
     to
     control
     the
     view
     shown
     in
     the
     bottom
     left
     graphics
     axes.
     Note
     that
     any
     parameter
     or
     fitness
     value
     can
     be
     plotted
     against
     any
     other
     parameter
     or
     fitness
     value
     on
     these
     axes,
     using
     various
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     types
     of
     two-dimensional
     plots
     (see
     Chapter
     <a 
href="QubistHTMLch5.html#x49-730005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:visualization --></a>).
     three-dimensional
     plots
     are
     also
     possible,
     but
     these
     take
     longer
     to
     render,
     and
     I
     personally
     find
     them
     less
     useful.
     There
     is
     a
     listbox
     control
     on
     the
     axes
     that
     can
     be
     used
     to
     control
     the
     type
     of
     graph
     shown.
     The
     listbox
     blocks
     part
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     of
     the
     figure
     and
     can
     be
     hidden
     by
     selecting
     &#8216;***
     HIDE
     ME***&#8217;,
     which
     is
     the
     first
     selection
     in
     the
     listbox
     control.
     To
     get
     the
     listbox
     back,
     the
     user
     needs
     to
     pause
     the
     run
     using
     the
     &#8216;Pause&#8217;
     button
     or
     the
     corresponding
     entry
     in
     the
     Control
     menu,
     and
     then
     un-pause
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     the
     run.<br />
     The
     bottom
     right
     graphics
     panel
     also
     has
     several
     possible
     views.
     The
     user
     can

     the
     critical
     parameter
     detection
     (CPD)
     plot,
     or
     a
     user-defined
     plot.
     The
     linkage
     matrix
     and
     CPD
     plots
     are
     explained

     demos
     implement
     a
     user
     plot
     by
     setting
     an
     option
     in
     the
     FerretSetup.m
     fill
     called
     <span

     to
     the
     name
     of
     a
     valid
     m-file
     on

     <a 
href="QubistHTMLse63.html#x91-1320008.20">8.20<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_interface --></a>).
     A

     function

     find

     a

     but
     I
     will
     briefly
     explain
     here
     what
     this
     does.
     While
     Ferret
     runs,
     it
     generates

     files,
     containing
     all
     of
     the
     best
     solutions
     encountered
     during
     each
     generation.
     Analysis
     causes
     Ferret
     to
     re-load
     all
     of
     the
     saved
     History
     files
     and
     compare
     all
     previously
     encountered
     solutions
     with
     each
     other
     in
     order
     to
     construct
     the
     final
     optimal
     set
     for
     the
     run.
     Analysis
     constructs
     a
     MATLAB
     data

     and
     holds
     the
     complete
     set
     of
     final
     results
     from
     your
     run.
     It
     can
     be
     loaded
     into

     by
     clicking
     on
     the

     or
