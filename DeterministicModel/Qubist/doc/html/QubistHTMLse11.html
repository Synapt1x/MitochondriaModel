<!--l. 1166--><p class="noindent" >The basic structure of Ferret-based application is illustrated in Figure <a 
href="#x23-320151">4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:flowchart --></a>. Ferret should not be thought of as a
traditional optimizer that is called from user-defined code, but rather as an integrated environment for optimization,
data-modeling, and visualization. Ferret normally serves as the graphical (or command-line) front end for each
project that is defined in the launchQubist.m file (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse14.html#x28-360004.4">4.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:projects --></a>), which is used to start Ferret. When using the
graphical user interface (which I encourage you to do for most applications), Ferret runs the project&#8217;s initialization
code when a project is selected from the interface. You can then start your project from the interface, and Ferret
will call the project&#8217;s fitness, output, and graphics functions, which are defined in a project-specific setup file (see
Chapter <a 
href="QubistHTMLch8.html#x67-990008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:FerretSetup --></a>), as required.

<!--l. 1169--><p class="noindent" >Ferret likes to be in charge of managing projects, and is not normally called <span 
class="cmti-10">from </span>the user&#8217;s project, although this <span 
class="cmti-10">is</span>
possible by setting up a custom launcher, as discussed later in this section. This technique of having the optimizer as
the front-end and calling out to user-defined functions may be a slight paradigm shift for some users, but this
mechanism has evolved over a number of years, and is extremely convenient and flexible to use. Most users like it
once they get used this way of doing things.

<!--l. 1187--><p class="noindent" >Using Ferret as a project manager means that you do not need to worry about the intricate details of the genetic
algorithm, or how all of your project-specific files need to be linked together. Ferret <span 
class="cmti-10">knows </span>when it needs to call your
initialization, fitness, output, graphics, and post-processing code, and it provides a nice interface to your code. As a
developer, letting Ferret look after these details saves you time, which you can spend developing the model
evaluated by your fitness function. This division of responsibility is absolutely fundamental to the design of Ferret
and the other Qubist optimizers. The user is responsible for making sure that the required project-specific functions
do what they need to do and return sensible values, and Ferret is completely responsible for linking the project
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
together, managing the optimization, and visualizing results. Ferret and the user-defined code operate at
arm&#8217;s length and are connected only through a few lines in the launchQubist.m file. A running Ferret
project <span 
class="cmti-10">looks </span>like it is completely integrated into the Ferret environment, but in reality, Ferret and the
user&#8217;s code remain completely independent, with no blending or intermingling of code whatsoever.

     Each

     by

     which
     shows
     how
     you
     can
     use
     the
     output
     function
     to
     do
     side
     calculations,
     monitor
     for
     convergence,
     or
     stop
     a
     run.
     Normally,
     the
     output
     function
     does
     not
     send
     back
     any
     return
     arguments.
     However,
     a
     mode
     is
     available
     that
     allows
     you
     to
     directly
     modify
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     your
     <span 
class="cmmi-10">extPar</span>
     data
     structure,
     or
     even
     the
     top-level
     <span 
class="cmmi-10">world</span>
     structure
     and
     send
     it
     back
     to
     Ferret.
     This
     is
     a
     special
     feature
     for
     advanced
     users
     and
     requires
     extreme
     caution,
     because
     sending
     back
     an
     inconsistent
     <span 
class="cmmi-10">world</span>
     could
     crash
     Ferret.
     This
     capability
     is
     sometimes
     useful
     for
     very
     large
     optimization
     problems
     where
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     you
     want
     to
     start
     with
     a
     simple
     function
     defined
     by
     only
     a
     few
     parameters,
     and
     gradually
     refine
     the
     function
     by
     adding
     parameters
     as
     Ferret
     converges
     to
     the
     solution.
     A
     good
     example
     is
     given
     by

<!--l. 1211--><p class="noindent" >Ferret (and Locust) require an analysis step at the end of a run to compile results, which is discussed in detail in
Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse25.html#x42-630004.15">4.15<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:analysis --></a>. Analysis loads all of the best solutions encountered during the run and compares all of the solutions
with each other by an iterative algorithm to construct the final optimal set. The analysis window launches, which
gives you access to Ferret&#8217;s visualization system, as discussed in Chapter <a 
href="QubistHTMLch5.html#x49-730005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:visualization --></a>. Analysis also generates an
OptimalSolutions.mat file, which can be loaded into MATLAB, or re-loaded into the visualization environment using

other custom analysis code that loads the <span 
class="cmmi-10">OptimalSolutions </span>data structure and does whatever post-processing analysis
or cleanup operations that the your application requires. Ferret can call this code automatically at the end of the

<!--l. 1221--><p class="noindent" >The most important concept illustrated in Figure <a 
href="#x23-320151">4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:flowchart --></a> is the clear separation between Ferret and the user&#8217;s
application code. Ferret communicates with the application only by sending parameters to the application&#8217;s fitness
function and receiving fitness values. Ferret does not need to know <span 
class="cmti-10">anything </span>about the application other than the
number of parameters, the range of each parameter, and the names of the fitness function, init function, and
other optional functions that it needs to communicate with. Ferret will explore your parameter space
thoroughly, minimize your fitness function, and map it out as completely as possible. It does this by
learning the detailed structure of the parameter space, purely from experience gained during the run.
Conversely, Ferret can be considered a &#8216;black box&#8217; optimizer, in the sense that your application doesn&#8217;t need
to know anything about how it is being optimized - it just needs to send back fitness values when
asked to evaluate parameters. A consequence of this clean separation is that Ferret and the user&#8217;s
application code are completely separate on disk, and Ferret&#8217;s EULA ensures that Ferret and the
user&#8217;s application remain distinct and entirely separate software products. They maintain an arm&#8217;s
length relationship, and talk only through a very thin communication layer. This in turn has two
consequences:

<!--l. 1228--><p class="noindent" >My advice for developing Ferret projects is to start with the fitness function, and whatever modeling code it needs
to run in order to evaluate parameter sets and return fitness values. Once you are reasonably confident that this is
working, you should split off any initialization code that produces the same result regardless of the parameter
values, and move it to the init function (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse16.html#x30-410004.6">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:init --></a>). In other words, any operation that only needs to be done
once but produces a result required by the fitness function should be placed in the init function. These
initialization operations usually involve setting paths required by the fitness function or myPlot function,
loading data, pre-processing data, or other preliminary calculations. The init function should return a
single structure, typically called <span 
class="cmmi-10">extPar</span>, which will be passed to the fitness function each time it is
called.
<!--l. 1230--><p class="noindent" >Next, you should get your fitness function working with init, so that the following lines of code work:

class="cmmi-10">X </span>is a matrix defined such that each column represents a parameter set, and the number of columns
represents the number of parameter sets to be evaluated (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse18.html#x33-470004.8">4.8<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:fitness --></a>). For multi-objective problems, the return
argument <span 
class="cmmi-10">F </span>should be a matrix defined such that each column represents the fitness values computed from the
corresponding column in <span 
class="cmmi-10">X</span>. The number of rows in <span 
class="cmmi-10">F </span>should therefore equal the number of objectives. It follows
that <span 
class="cmmi-10">F </span>should be a row vector for single objective problems. You should literally make a &#8216;fake&#8217; <span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>with the correct
number of parameters and a few columns, with all parameters in the range of the search, and run this independently
of Ferret. This allows you to fix errors before connecting your code to Ferret, which makes things simpler for
debugging.

<!--l. 1248--><p class="noindent" >You should copy a template of the FerretSetup file into your project directory and start modifying it to better suit
your application. At this stage, you should concentrate on the most basic settings in the <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.general </span>section of the
setup file (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse46.html#x71-1020008.3">8.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_general --></a>), specifically those that tell Ferret about the allowed range of each parameter, its name,
and the name of each objective. This is already enough to link your project to Ferret and start running it, following
the procedure in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse14.html#x28-360004.4">4.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:projects --></a>.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
<!--l. 1250--><p class="noindent" >You should do a very short test run to make sure that that Ferret starts and your project loads, but please be aware
that Ferret will be using default settings (in [Qubist_Home]/user/Ferret/defaults/defaultFerretSetup.m; see Section
<a 
href="QubistHTMLse17.html#x32-460004.7">4.7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:setup --></a> for details) at this point for all but the most critical parameters. These may not be very suitable for your
project, so don&#8217;t expect fantastic results on this test run. Setup files are discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse17.html#x32-460004.7">4.7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:setup --></a>, and
Chapter <a 
href="QubistHTMLch8.html#x67-990008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:FerretSetup --></a> covers all possible options in detail. Setup files can be complicated, but you should try not to
get too bogged down in the details. Try to use as many of the default settings as possible during the
early stages of a project by commenting out or deleting non-crucial lines that don&#8217;t absolutely need
to be modified, and gradually refine your setup as the project evolves and you gain experience with
it.

<!--l. 1253--><p class="noindent" >Finally, you can write an output function to implement a customized stopping criterion (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse19.html#x34-530004.9.2">4.9.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:customStopping --></a>), a myPlot
function to embed customized graphics in the Ferret window if you wish (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse20.html#x36-550004.10">4.10<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:myPlot --></a>), and any necessary
post-processing code (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse29.html#x47-710004.19">4.19<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:postProcess --></a>). The overall thrust of my advice is that you should take advantage of Ferret&#8217;s
modular design to develop your project one piece at a time. Chances are good that you have chosen to use
sophisticated optimization software because your problem is complicated. You should therefore not expect to build
your entire solution at once and just run it when you&#8217;re done. It is much easier, and I think better, to
put your project together a piece at a time and check that things are working as expected at each
step.

<!--l. 1258--><p class="noindent" >This concludes my brief overview of Ferret, and hopefully explains why it is designed to operate primarily as the
front-end for its projects. All of the other Qubist optimizers are also designed to work like this, and in fact
communicate with the same project files that Ferret uses. Most users find this to be an easy, powerful, and
productive way of doing things, and I hope that you share this experience. However, it is possible to circumvent my
preferred method of using Ferret as a project&#8217;s front end by building a custom launch file, as discussed in Section
<a 
href="QubistHTMLse24.html#x41-610004.14.2">4.14.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:customLauncher --></a>. Custom launchers can contain any user-defined code and call Ferret as a regular MATLAB function. I do not
personally find this useful, except for problems that require batch-processing - automatically running Ferret many
times on different data sets or with different configurations. However, I have encountered users who really prefer this
method because they like the fine degree of control that it allows, or regard graphical user interfaces as
wasteful of computational resources. Ferret comes with a custom launcher template, which makes
it relatively easy to set these up, so give it a try if you prefer this over the standard way of doing
things!
