<!--l. 8179--><p class="noindent" >I think Douglas Adams had it right with this quote - the origin of complex structure and behaviour in a universe
governed by rules that usually turn out to be simple at a fundamental level, is a deep mystery that deserves
contemplation and wonder. This quote is one that resonates strongly with me and is really at the heart of my
fascination with global optimization. The most amazing thing in the world to me is that complex
and perhaps even intelligent behaviour can develop from simple interacting parts, as an emergent
property of the system. Ferret, Locust, and Anvil are all made up of simple parts that interact by simple
rules:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">
     individuals
     mutate,
     compete,
     and
     recombine
     via
     genetic
     operators
     for
     Ferret,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">
     particles
     interact
     by
     swarm
     dynamics
     in
     Locust,
     </li>
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     <li class="itemize">
     search
     paths
     obey
     statistical
     physics
     in
     Anvil,
     but
     interact
     via
     genetic
     operators.</li></ul>
<!--l. 8185--><p class="noindent" >These programs aren&#8217;t nearly as complex as real systems found in nature, but they are complex enough
that new and sometimes unexpected behaviours emerge as a global property of the system. Unlike
most natural systems though, you can tinker with the rules of a computer program to try to get the
emergent behaviour that you want - in this case thorough exploration of the parameter space and global
optimization.
<!--l. 8187--><p class="noindent" >Actually finding and refining the simple rules at the heart of these optimizers was a subtle and often
counter-intuitive business that required what seemed like an endless sequence of numerical experiments. There is no
formula or deductive process that can reliably tell you how the large-scale emergent behaviour of these systems will
react when you change the rules governing how its component parts interact, but over time it is possible to gain
some intuition for how things work. I hope that you will gain similar intuition by playing with the setting of the
optimizers and trying them on a variety of problems.
<!--l. 8189--><p class="noindent" >The Qubist package has been my passion for the last seven years and has greatly exceeded my wildest dreams of
where this might lead. If someone had asked me in 2002 how far this would go, I would have expressed enthusiasm
for a novel class of optimizers that I had recently become interested in, and my hope that they would solve the
data-modeling problem that got all of this started. But I would not have guessed that it would lead
me <span 
class="cmti-10">here </span>or that my first simple, awkward genetic algorithms would develop into anything on this
scale. Qubist, and especially Ferret, has been the source of great moments of insight, uncountable
late nights, and at times enormous frustration. There have been many occasions when the technical
obstacles seemed insurmountable, but the joy of an occasional deep insight exceeded the pain of numerous
dead ends. Overall, I have had fun developing these tools. I persevered and I think things worked out
well.

<!--l. 8192--><p class="noindent" >Writing this user&#8217;s guide was a major project of its own. I started writing something like a manual or user&#8217;s guide
approximately five times since 2006, and abandoned all attempts except for the final one that led
to this guide. In all honesty, I find developing the software and my academic research vastly more
enjoyable than writing documentation, and I was too often distracted from this task by developing new
features or fixing problems in the code. Moreover, I have juggled the Qubist project with my academic
position at the University of Manitoba. All too often, other things had to take priority, and this user&#8217;s
guide was unfortunately at a lower priority than maintaining the code itself when my day job got
demanding.
<!--l. 8194--><p class="noindent" >The time was right for this project in 2009, when I felt that Ferret-4&#8217;s development had leveled off somewhat for the
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
time being, and I was reasonably happy with the other optimizers in the Qubist package. I &#8216;bit the bullet&#8217; and wrote
most of this text during the summer of 2009. The biggest revelation of this process was that I had
all but forgotten many features of my own software. I rediscovered, checked, critiqued, and in some
cases fixed dusty old corners of the code that I had not looked at in years. I also critically reviewed
newer components like Anvil and Locust. Anvil only required moderate streamlining, but I thoroughly
overhauled Locust when I realized that it was overly complex and contained some features that were of
uncertain value. This overhaul also resulted in significant new insights that dramatically improved the
code, which ultimately resulted in Locust-2. The net result of this user&#8217;s guide on Qubist is a more
streamlined, unified, and thoroughly error-checked software package that I can distribute with pride and
confidence.

<!--l. 8198--><p class="noindent" >I have many people to thank for their support throughout the development of Qubist and the writing of this guide.
Dr. Jim Hesser&#8217;s encouragement and boundless enthusiasm were especially inspiring during the early days of the
project, when I was a Plaskett Research Fellow at the National Research Council Dominion Astronomical
Observatory (DAO) in Victoria. I am also thankful to the Millimetre Astronomy Group at the DAO,
especially Paul Feldman and Russell Redman, who provided data and helped pose the tough data-fitting
problem that got me thinking in this direction back in 2002. I have been treating Qubist as professional,
commercial software since 2007, when nQube was formed. However, Ferret could not have developed to its
present level without the many comments and bug reports from my colleagues, students, and friends at
the University of Manitoba. I especially thank my Ph.D. student Adam Rogers and summer research
student Andrew Cull, whose ability to break my software is only exceeded by their diligence in sending
well-documented bug reports. Another summer research student, Blair Cardigan Smith, worked with me on an
especially difficult data-modeling problem and really helped to probe Ferret&#8217;s limitations, which I
strove to expand. I thank my colleagues Dr. Boyd McCurdy and Dr. Peter Potrebko at CancerCare
Manitoba for their enthusiastic collaboration on the most important and inspiring application of Qubist to
date in the field of cancer radiotherapy. <a 
 id="dx134-223005"></a>Finally, I thank my friend and former student Stasi Baran for
reading this entire guide, providing excellent editorial comments, and correcting many errors in the
text.
<!--l. 8201--><p class="noindent" >Having just finished writing a fairly lengthy user&#8217;s guide, I have taken a complete inventory of the Qubist package.
Perhaps it is not surprising that this would lead to a comprehensive &#8216;bird&#8217;s eye&#8217; view of the entire
code, which I have not experienced in some time. As Qubist&#8217;s sole developer, I am sometimes guilty
of focusing too much on the trees and not enough on the forest. This package has developed by the
accumulation of many small insights, plus a few larger ones, and a staggering amount of hard work
dealing with the intricate details of this complex software. However, I have been asking myself the &#8216;big
picture&#8217; questions lately - especially the biggest of them all: &#8220;So where will Qubist go from here?&#8221; I have
many ideas in this regard, but this is not the place to reveal them in detail. I certainly anticipate
ongoing core development of the Qubist package, perhaps with greater focus on particle swarms and
visualization, and perhaps even greater emphasis on applications and collaborations in academia and industry.
What I can say with certainty is that Qubist has taken on a life of its own, and development will
continue vigorously for the foreseeable future. I am more excited about this work now than at any time
in the past, and I will continue to push Qubist forward with all of my ability, to bring previously
intractable problems in optimization and data modeling into the realm of that which is technically
feasible.
