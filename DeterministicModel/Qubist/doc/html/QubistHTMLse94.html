<!--l. 7923--><p class="noindent" >Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse27.html#x45-690004.17">4.17<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:resumeRun --></a> discussed a simple technique for resuming Ferret runs that works when neither the project
directory nor the data directory have been moved. This simple method is most often used to resume
suspended or crashed runs, but I also discussed several common scenarios in that section where these
conditions are not true and the simple technique therefore cannot be used. Briefly, this situation arises
when:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">
     Files
     are
     moved
     for
     archiving
     and
     you
     need
     to
     restart
     an
     old
     run.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">
     If
     you
     send
     your
     History
     files
     to
     someone,
     and
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     they
     need
     to
     restart
     the
     run.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">
     If
     your
     project
     is
     coded
     such
     that
     it
     names
     the
     run
     automatically
     using
     the
     date,
     and
     you
     need
     to
     restart
     it
     on
     a
     different
     date
     than
     when
     it
     was
     originally
     started.</li></ul>
<!--l. 7929--><p class="noindent" >These situations are not at all contrived, and I find that the Resume Tool gets a lot of use. Note that it can be used
for Locust runs as well as Ferret runs.
<!--l. 7931--><p class="noindent" >The Resume Tool is started from the Component Selector window (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse10.html#x21-300003.2">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:launcher --></a>) and is just a series of dialogue
boxes that ask you to locate the data and project directories on disk, and identify a file to load paths, if required.
The exact procedure should be carried out as follows:

     <!--l. 7947--><p class="noindent" >Usually, you load additional paths by including &#8216;addpath&#8217; lines in the init file, but you can also load paths
     from any other file if the init file calls it. If you require additional paths, click &#8216;yes&#8217; in the dialogue box, which
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     will start a file navigation window that will allow you to select your path-loading file. Navigate to your file,
     click &#8216;Open&#8217;, and your Ferret or Locust run should resume. Note that if your additional paths are defined in
     your init file, then running this file will load them, but the <span 
class="cmmi-10">extPar </span>structure normally generated by init <span 
class="cmti-10">will</span>
     <span

class="cmmi-10">extPar </span>structure will be recovered from
     History files instead. For this reason, I usually put path-loading instructions in a separate file
     that is called by by init file, so that I do not have to run the entire init file just to load a few
     paths.</li></ol>

in the directory navigation window for some operating systems. These steps should become second nature after you
