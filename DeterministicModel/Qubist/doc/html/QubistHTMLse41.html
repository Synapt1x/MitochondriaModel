<!--l. 3933--><p class="noindent" >The purpose of this section is to outline the use of Ferret&#8217;s auto-adaptation system. This section is short due to the
&#8216;auto&#8217; in &#8216;auto-adaptation&#8217; - other than the initial setup of the auto-adaptation options in the setup
file (discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse47.html#x72-1030008.4">8.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_strategy --></a>), there is really not much for the user to do with the auto-adaptation
interface, other than observe how Ferret has optimized your settings. Ferret&#8217;s auto-adaptation system is
designed to learn from experience and to maximize the probability that a strategy parameter will
have a positive effect on the run&#8217;s development. Figure <a 
href="#x64-960041">7.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:strategyAutoAdapt --></a> shows the auto-adaptation interface in
action. The text panel on the left gives the current <span 
class="cmti-10">mean </span>values for all strategy parameters that can be
controlled adaptively, and whether they are currently under adaptive control or are &#8216;frozen&#8217; (set to a fixed
value). The initial state of each parameter is given by the settings in <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.strategy</span>; see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse47.html#x72-1030008.4">8.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_strategy --></a> for
details.
<!--l. 3935--><p class="noindent" >The dropbox under the text panel allows you to select a strategy parameter. The current parameter in
this case is the mutation scale, which is the average RMS (root mean square) size of mutations, as
discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse50.html#x76-1060008.7">8.7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_mutation --></a>. The graphs on the right hand side and the buttons on the bottom show the
current probability distribution function and history of the selected parameter over the course of the
run. The top figure on the right is a histogram showing the probability of that a particular value will
be chosen; this graph and the text box to its left show that values chosen for <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.mutation.scale</span>
follow a distribution centred on a value of 0.0161 at present, and that the probability falls to zero
for larger values. The bottom right figure shows the history of the strategy parameter throughout
the run. We see the mutation scale started with an average value of 0.25 (from the user&#8217;s setup file)
but dropped to its present value by about generation 400. An overall decrease in the mutation scale
makes sense for most problems because large mutations are often less useful late in the run after the
population has mostly converged. Note that the gradual drop in mutation scale is punctuated with
occasional and very abrupt jumps, when for some reason, a few relatively large mutations &#8216;get lucky&#8217; and
find good solutions. This surprising behaviour is commonly seen when the mutation scale is under
adaptive control, and is actually quite useful because it very effectively stirs up the population once in a
while, even after it has mostly converged. This helps to continue exploration even late in the run, and
combat against genetic drift, a common problem of genetic algorithms that I discussed in Section
<a 
href="QubistHTMLse2.html#x8-110002.2.3">2.2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:MOO_Ferret --></a>.
<!--l. 3937--><p class="noindent" >The distribution is similar to the positive side of a Gaussian centred on zero, except for a sharp dip at the origin,
which is useful because mutations of size nearly equal to zero are pointless. Note that Ferret suppresses very small
mutations, even when the distribution is forced to be a Gaussian in the auto-adaptation interface, as discussed
below.

<!--l. 3947--><p class="noindent" >The buttons below the graphs can be used to toggle the current strategy parameter, shown in the drop box, between
full <span 
class="cmti-10">non-parametric </span>adaptation (using the probability distribution shown in the top right figure), freezing the
parameter at it&#8217;s present value, or allowing it to adapt, but forcing the distribution to be Gaussian. Generally, I
prefer fully non-parametric, auto-adaptation. It is also possible to &#8216;tweak&#8217; the distribution using the arrows in the
upper corners of the top right figure. These arrows allow you to move the boundaries of the figure to effectively shift
the distribution function to higher or lower values. I don&#8217;t generally do this, and I am not aware of any
users who do this regularly, but the option is there if you feel that that auto-adaptation has chosen a
distribution centred on values that are too high or too low for your problem. Note that dropping the
mutation scale, crossover dispersion, or crossover strength to very low values by hand could result in
premature convergence. It is generally safe to increase the values for these parameters, but decreasing
them should be done with caution. Please refer to Sections <a 
href="QubistHTMLse50.html#x76-1060008.7">8.7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_mutation --></a> and <a 
href="QubistHTMLse51.html#x77-1070008.8">8.8<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_XOver --></a> for advice on setting these
