<!--l. 5284--><p class="noindent" >SAMOSA is a simple but surprisingly powerful optimizer based on the well-known Nelder-Mead simplex method,
whose name is an acronym that stands for &#8216;Simple Approach to a Multi-Objective Simplex Algorithm&#8217;. If you have
used MATLAB&#8217;s built-in fminsearch function, then you have already used a simplex optimizer and SAMOSA&#8217;s
behaviour will seem familiar, at least on single-objective problems. If you are curious about how the simplex method
works, I recommend reading the chapter on optimization methods in the one of the Numerical Recipes
books, some of which are available online free of charge at http://www.nrbook.com. As you may have
guessed (or read earlier in this user&#8217;s guide), the main difference between SAMOSA and a standard
simplex algorithm is that SAMOSA is designed for multi-objective optimization problems, which are not
possible with the standard implementation of the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. I developed this
tool because I needed a lightweight multi-objective local optimizer and polisher for Ferret, and to a
lesser extent, Locust. SAMOSA suits this purpose extremely well, and I am very pleased with this
little program. The Anvil simulated annealing code and the SemiGloSS &#8216;solution spray&#8217; optimizer can
also be used as polishers at the end of a run (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse61.html#x89-1270008.18">8.18<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_polish --></a>), but SAMOSA is the default for both
Ferret&#8217;s local optimization step (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse60.html#x88-1260008.17">8.17<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_localOpt --></a>) and polisher for multi-objective runs, and my usual
choice for both of these purposes. Note that it can also be used as a standalone multi-objective local
optimizer.

<!--l. 5289--><p class="noindent" >SAMOSA is very simple to configure, and section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse73.html#x102-1490009.10">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:SAMOSA_setup --></a> will run through its configuration options. However, you
should realize that SAMOSA can read the setup files used to control Ferret or Locust. If you have put
together a project that already works with one of these optimizers, then it&#8217;s already set up to work with
SAMOSA! There are functions in the Qubist distribution called &#8216;translateFerretToSAMOSA.m&#8217; and
&#8216;translateLocustToSAMOSA.m&#8217; that read Ferret or Locust setup files and make sensible choices for related
SAMOSA settings. This is usually adequate for polishing Ferret solutions, but you should still configure
your own SAMOSA_setup file for some additional fine control if you want to use it as a standalone
optimizer.
