<!--l. 4405--><p class="noindent" >Crossover combines two individuals by mixing their parameters, which results in a new individual that shares some
traits with each parent. This is a straightforward operation in a standard binary genetic algorithm, where strings of
zeros and ones are simply cut, recombined, and spliced back together. However, Ferret&#8217;s parameter
representation admits a more elaborate crossover operator because it is based on real vector spaces, and
vectors naturally lead to notions of geometry. Ferret&#8217;s most important crossover operator, which I
refer to as &#8216;X-Type&#8217; crossover, is a geometry-based operator that is in some ways analogous to the bit
string operator found in traditional binary encoded GAs. X-Type crossover is discussed in Section
<a 
href="#x77-1080008.8.1">8.8.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:XOverX --></a>.
<!--l. 4407--><p class="noindent" >Ferret also has a second type of crossover operator, which is at the heart of its linkage-learning system, and has no
analogy in traditional genetic algorithms. I refer to this second type of crossover as &#8216;building block crossover&#8217;, and it
is discussed in Section <a

of two individuals and selects a point between the individuals on that line. There are some useful modifications to
this process, which I discuss below, but that is the basic geometric idea. The options for Ferret&#8217;s &#8216;X-Type&#8217; crossover

<!--l. 4441--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.PXOver </span>is the probability that an individual will engage in crossover with another individual in any
given generation. Crossover is crucial for mixing the parameter space and propagating new solutions throughout the
population. I recommend setting <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.PXover=1 </span>for most problems.

<!--l. 4445--><p class="noindent" >Crossovers are restricted to a subset of parameters defined by a single, randomly chosen building block (discovered
by linkage learning) when <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.BBRestricted =true</span>. In my experience, this only appears to be useful for
large, non-parametric problems, with possibly hundreds of parameters (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse30.html#x48-720004.20">4.20<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:nonParametric --></a> or the demo
&#8216;Advanced/Non-Parametric-Image-Modeling&#8217;). The default setting <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.BBRestricted =false </span>is the best
setting for most other problems, since it allows Ferret to decide automatically when to restrict crossovers to
individual building blocks or do unrestricted crossovers over all parameters.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
<!--l. 4447--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.strength </span>influences the magnitude of the perturbations caused by crossover events. Normally, the
magnitude is given by the absolute value of a Gaussian random variable, whose standard deviation is equal to
<span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.strength</span>. The crossover is scaled such that the newly recombined solution is halfway between the
parents when a magnitude of 0.5 is drawn from the Gaussian distribution. A magnitude of 0 corresponds to no
crossover at all, while a magnitude of 1 moves all the way over to the opposite parent to form the child solution,
which also means that there is effectively no crossover.
<!--l. 4450--><p class="noindent" >A Gaussian random variable has no upper limit, but a crossover magnitude greater than 1 overshoots the opposite
parent. Therefore, the Gaussian distribution of crossover magnitudes is truncated at a value equal to
<span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.maxScale</span>. When a magnitude is drawn that is larger than this value, it is replaced with a uniform
random number between 0 and <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.maxScale</span>. It is actually beneficial to set this value slightly higher than 1
because an occasional <span 
class="cmti-10">slight </span>overshoot helps to fill out linear features in the optimal set. This subtlety works much
like the &#8216;anti-crossover&#8217; operator discussed below.
<!--l. 4452--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.antiXOverProb </span>is the probability of an &#8216;anti-crossover&#8217; event. Basically, anti-crossover just reverses the
direction of a normal crossover event. Instead of moving a point closer to its mate, it moves further away. I would be
the first person to agree that this is a counter-intuitive idea, but I have observed many times that this usually leads
to better mapping of parameter space, especially when there are long linear features present in the
optimal set. This option has been available since Ferret-1 and I used it on an astrophysical problem
as early as 2002 (published 2004; see <a 
href="QubistHTMLli1.html#Xfiege04">Fiege et al.</a>&#x00A0;[<a 
href="QubistHTMLli1.html#Xfiege04">2004</a>]). While useful, this should not happen too
often. The antiXOverProb probability is set to zero by default, and probably should not exceed about
10%.

<!--l. 4455--><p class="noindent" >Lethals are poor solutions that result from the crossover of two good parent solutions. Ferret contains an &#8216;Advanced
Lethal Suppression&#8217; (ALS) algorithm, which is designed to decrease the number of lethals by avoiding poor regions
of parameter space during crossover. ALS is controlled by <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.ALS</span>, which should be a real number between 0
(ALS off) and 1 (maximum ALS). The ALS system works quite well, and the effect can be observed by turning it on
and off in the Ring/Ring-2D demonstration found in the Demo menu. Note that ALS is one of the parameters that
is controlled by Ferret&#8217;s strategy auto-adaptation system. I usually leave this on, but it rarely chooses a well-defined
value for this parameter. I would be inclined to turn ALS on manually for problems if I suspect that it is really
necessary.
<!--l. 4457--><p class="noindent" >Ferret&#8217;s crossover operator includes a &#8216;dispersion&#8217; step, which plays an important role in helping solutions to expand
throughout the optimal set and fill it out uniformly. Dispersion is essentially an extra mutation step in which the
magnitude of the mutation scales with the magnitude of the crossover event. Without dispersion, crossovers follow a
line joining the two parameter sets that are involved. However, when dispersion is included, this line is broadened to
fill a multi-dimensional region centred on the line, which is why crossover plus dispersion helps to
fill the optimal set more completely than crossover alone. Ferret contains three distinct dispersion
techniques.

class="cmtt-10">par.XOver.matingRestriction </span>is an option that affects how mates are chosen prior to crossover. It works much
like the <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.selection.competitionRestriction </span>parameter, but is much more useful. The <span 
class="cmmi-10">matingRestriction</span>
parameter can range from -1 to 1 and is set to 0 by default. Individuals engage in crossover preferentially with
individuals that are nearby in parameter space when <span 
class="cmmi-10">matingRestriction &#x003C; </span>0, and with individuals that are distant
when <span 
class="cmmi-10">matingRestriction &#x003E; </span>0. Mating restriction is turned off when this parameter is set to zero.
Negative values are often beneficial because crossovers between two nearby good solutions are likely to
result in another high quality solution, while crossovers between more distant individuals are more
likely to produce a poor solution. Negative values have a similar effect to ALS, and also to setting
<span

set the <span 
class="cmmi-10">matingRestriction </span>parameter to about -0.5 initially for my problems. Negative values are often
useful and I have never observed a case where a moderate negative mating restriction was actually
harmful. Positive values are usually damaging because of the increased probability of lethals, and are not
recommended.
<!--l. 4486--><p class="noindent" >Note that <span

auto-adaptation system, although it is usually not very tightly controlled. Nevertheless, auto-adaptation will usually
prefer values centred on zero, or negative values for this parameter, which is consistent with the comments
above.

<!--l. 4494--><p class="noindent" >Building block crossover involves swapping an entire building block in its entirety between two individuals. This
very simple operation is fundamental to the improvements that result from Ferret&#8217;s linkage learning system. The

blocks, and is therefore an essential part of Ferret&#8217;s linkage-learning system. The operator has no effect when

<!--l. 4508--><p class="noindent" ><span

engage in building-block crossover at a given generation. Normally, the thorough mixing of building blocks is a good
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
thing, and I leave this parameter set equal to its default value of 1 to maximize the effects of linkage-learning. I have
never seen a case where it was clear that a lower setting was beneficial.
<!--l. 4510--><p class="noindent" >Ferret actually contains two different (and mutually exclusive) methods for recombining and performing selection on
building blocks. By default, <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOverBB.multiBB=0 </span>(false) so that building block crossover and selection operate
only on a single building block for each mating pair of solutions. However, it is possible to process multiple building
blocks simultaneously by setting <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOverBB.multiBB=1 </span>(true). This may result in faster convergence of the
linkage map, and therefore faster convergence of the population to the optimal set. Both options work well,
although I regard single building block crossover to be somewhat more conservative, and this is my usual
choice.
<!--l. 4512--><p class="noindent" >The mixing and selection of building blocks is so important in Ferret that I sometimes like to go through several
passes of these operations before proceeding to other operations in the generational cycle. Therefore, I have included
an option <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.XOverBB.NPass</span>, which is an integer that controls the number of building block crossover/selection
passes per generation. This is set equal to 1 by default, but I have seen problems where a higher setting can result in
a faster and more reliable solution due to greater mixing of building blocks. Note, however, that a
greater number of solutions will need to be processed each generation, and generations will take longer.
More processing will be done each generation though, so Ferret&#8217;s performance as a whole might not be
degraded.
