<!--l. 1030--><p class="noindent" >You can be assured that I dislike legal formalities more than most people, but you can&#8217;t distribute software without
an End User License Agreement. However, I have tried to make this as simple and as painless as possible. Please
read it yourself, but the EULA mostly says things that amount to &#8216;Please don&#8217;t steal my software&#8217; and &#8216;It&#8217;s not my
fault if Qubist doesn&#8217;t work on your particular problem and terrible things happen as a result&#8217; - all written in
sufficiently opaque legalese, of course.

<!--l. 1055--><p class="noindent" >You should have received a license key with your copy of Qubist, which you need to unlock the toolbox. You should
enter your key in the appropriate textbox, certify that you understand the EULA agreement, and accept the
agreement. The key unlocks Qubist for all users on your system, and will not be required again unless you re-install
the package for some reason, or upgrade it with a new version from nQube. <span

<span

<span

anything I release should be safe to use and at least as bug-free as the previous version. You can always rename your
old Qubist directory if installing a brand new version makes you nervous. The installation of an update
will never delete or disable a previous version, unless you manually over-write the files during the
installation.

<!--l. 1058--><p class="noindent" >It is important to note that each copy of Qubist is locked to a specific MATLAB license number and list of hardware
addresses that you specified when you ordered your copy of the package. Qubist cannot be moved to other machines
or run under a different MATLAB license, because every copy of the package is custom-built and this information is
coded right into the p-files.  If you try to do this, it will fail and you will probably see a fairly cryptic error message
asking you to contact the developer.
<!--l. 1060--><p class="noindent" >If you need to move Qubist to a different machine or associate it with a different MATLAB license, you should
contact nQube and update your information. A new copy will be built for you promptly and at no
charge. Users with a current maintenance agreement with nQube will receive an update that works
with their new hardware and/or MATLAB license. Users without a maintenance agreement may be
updated to an earlier release that was current at the time that their maintenance agreement expired.
