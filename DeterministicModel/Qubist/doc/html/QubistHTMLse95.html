<!--l. 7969--><p class="noindent" >It is possible to analyze previously saved History files using the &#8216;Analyze History Tool&#8217;, which can be started from
the &#8216;Analyze History&#8217; radio button in the launcher window. This is useful for analyzing previously completed runs
after the Ferret or Locust console window has been closed. I use this feature frequently when doing multiple sets of
Ferret/Locust runs for a project (often for testing), when I find it more convenient to keep the queue of runs
moving, rather than pausing for analysis when each run finishes. The &#8216;Analyze History&#8217; interface allows me to
reserve my faster computers for the runs themselves, and I can do my analysis and visualization on a less
powerful machine afterwards, as each set finishes. The Analyze History interface is a simple menu-driven
system that presents the user with a set of dialogue boxes to load the History files and other project
information.
