<!--l. 4701--><p class="noindent" >Elitism is commonly used in genetic algorithms to ensure that the best solutions present in each generation survive
the random perturbations due to mutation and the parameter space mixing of crossover events. The basic idea is
that a small fraction of the very best solutions are selected each generation and preserved for the next.
Thus, the fitness of the best individual in the population should always improve monotonically for
single-objective problems when elitism is used. Likewise, the trade-off surface as a whole should improve
monotonically for multi-objective problems, although this is not necessarily true of the individual
objectives.

<!--l. 4714--><p class="noindent" >Ferret&#8217;s elitism operator is very effective, and turning this option on has resulted in improved performance for every
problem that I have ever encountered. I therefore strongly encourage you to use this feature, and I
recommend setting <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.elitism.frac</span>, the fraction of the population saved in elites each generation, to at
least a few percent. Elitism is turned off when <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.elitism.frac=0</span>. If you only want a single elite
per population, just set <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.elitism.frac </span>to some arbitrarily small number that is greater than
zero; for example, <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.elitism.frac=1e-6</span>. It is sometimes useful to turn <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.elitism.frac </span>up
as high as about 20% for parameter space-mapping problems, which may be either multi-objective
problems, or single-objective problems where <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.selection.FAbsTol</span>, <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.selection.FRelTol</span>, or
<span 
class="cmtt-10">par.selection.FRankTol </span>are set to a value greater than zero (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse49.html#x74-1050008.6">8.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_selection --></a>). Such high values of the
elitism fraction would probably raise eyebrows for most users experienced with other genetic algorithms.
However, the implementation of elitism in Ferret is quite different, and such high values are occasionally
beneficial.
<!--l. 4716--><p class="noindent" >The initial round of selection of elites is based on the fitness parameter, for single-objective problems, or on Pareto
fitness rank for multi-objective problems. However, parameter space-mapping problems (single or multi-objective)
are characterized by the property that they have an optimal region that does not reduce to a single solution. Thus,
it is sensible to include a second round of elite selection based on the niching principle, using the same tournament
priorities discussed in Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse52.html#x78-1100008.9">8.9<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_niching --></a>. For such problems, the most valuable solutions are in the optimal region <span 
class="cmti-10">and</span>
have a low niche count (see Section <a 
href="QubistHTMLse52.html#x78-1100008.9">8.9<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:par_niching --></a>). These solutions are the ones that are preferentially chosen as
elites.

<!--l. 4719--><p class="noindent" >You are likely to notice an interesting phenomenon if you carefully observe the behaviour of elites
on parameter space-mapping problems, when X-niching is selected. A good example of this type of
problem is the demonstration labelled as &#8216;Multi-Objective/Triangle-Subspace-X-Niching&#8217;, which can
be accessed from Ferret&#8217;s &#8216;Demo&#8217; menu. What you should see is that the elites will tend to cluster
around the boundaries of the optimal set and effectively &#8216;shepherd&#8217; the solutions residing in the interior
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
region. The shepherding behaviour is due to the fact that elite selection is based, in part, on niching;
solutions that are on the boundary of the optimal region tend to have fewer near neighbours, and are
therefore selected preferentially by the niching operator. Shepherding is extremely helpful in parameter
space-mapping problems because these elites form a relatively stable perimeter around the edge of the
optimal region, while the interior solutions continue to explore. Their density will be especially high
near convex corners of an optimal set, such as the corners of the triangle in the example mentioned
above. The overall effect after analyzing the runs is that the interior part of the optimal region will be
well-explored, but there will be a somewhat higher density of solutions near the edge; this non-uniform
coverage is a good thing, because it helps to discriminate between the interior optimal region, and the
non-optimal region on the outside. This is also why it is acceptable to use a relatively high value for
<span 
class="cmtt-10">par.elitism.frac </span>on such problems. Note that this is not likely to cause problems with premature
convergence, which could result from a high values of the elitism fraction in some genetic algorithms. Ferret
includes many safeguards that explicitly prevent elite solutions from dominating the population too early
in the run, when the emphasis should be on exploration rather than the exploitation of the optimal
region.
<!--l. 4721--><p class="noindent" >Ferret&#8217;s elitism operator contains a second parameter called <span 
class="cmtt-10">par.elitism.mode</span>, which should be set to either
&#8216;normal&#8217; or &#8217;boundary&#8217;. The boundary option places somewhat greater emphasis on shepherding by explicitly
selecting solutions that are near the boundary between the optimal and non-optimal region. In my
experience, normal elitism provides adequate shepherding and I rarely use the boundary elitism mode in
practice. Nevertheless, I think this is an interesting feature that might be useful to some users. I have
therefore left it as an option in the code, which might become more prevalent in future versions of the
software.
