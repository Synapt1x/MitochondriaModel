To add your own projects to the Projects menu:

Edit the file 'FerretGlobalProjects.m' (in the Ferret home directory)
to add GLOBAL projects, that are ACCESSIBLE TO ALL USERS.  To add projects
that are PRIVATE TO A PARTICULAR USER, edit the file 'FerretUserProjects.m'
(anywhere on the user's Matlab path, but usually inside of the
'launchFerret.m' function in the user's application directory or home
directory.  Add information about your projects in the following format: 

projects{n}.path='/full/path/to/project/directory'; %[default: ./]

projects{n}.name='Project Name';

        %[default: deepest directory in projects{n}.path]

projects{n}.init='initializationCode'; %[default: none]

projects{n}.setup='FerretSetupFile'; %[default: 'FerretSetup']

Here, n is an integer giving the number of the entry in the projects
menu.  Start at n=1 for the 1st entry, n=2 for the 2nd, etc.
Path should be the full directory path to the project, which contains
the setup file and the fitness m-file.  Name is the arbitrary name of
the project.  Init is an optional initilization m-file that produces
an external parameter structure that is passed to Ferret.  Setup is
the name of the Ferret setup file.
