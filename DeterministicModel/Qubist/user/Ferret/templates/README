Notes on FerretSetup.m file
===========================

Every Ferret run requires a setup file, which is names 'FerretSetup.m' by default
This is usually coded as a Matlab structure, as in these template files.

Other names are possible for the setup file if the user sends a 2nd argument to
Ferret when the profram is called:

% Ferret accepts 0, 1, or 2 arguments.
% [XPhys,F,varargout]=Ferret(externalParameterStructure, setupFileName)
% 0 --> Use defaultFerretSetup
% 1 --> Use FerretSetup
% 2 --> Use arbitrarily named setup file setupFile
%       (either .m or .txt file) 

Note that FerretSetup calls SemiGloSS_setup.  This line can be removed
if the user wants to use the default settings.

Note that FerretSetup files can also be coded as simple text files
that are automatically parsed by Ferret.  See examples for this usage.
