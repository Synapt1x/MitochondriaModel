% Important note on default setup files for SAMOSA, Anvil, and SemiGloSS:
% ====================================================
% Defaults for Anvil, SAMOSA, and SemiGloSS in this directory
% ([Qubist_Home]\user\Anvil\defaults) will be used when these optimizers
% are called as Ferret's polisher ONLY.  Anvil, SAMOSA, and SemiGloSS also
% have default setup files in their own directories:
%
% [Qubist_Home]\user\Anvil\defaults
% [Qubist_Home]\user\SAMOSA\defaults
% [Qubist_Home]\user\SemiGloSS\defaults
%
% The setup files in these directories will be used when these optimizers
% are used in standalone mode.

Setup Notes:

1. PCCompeteGlobal should be significantly less than 1.  When set to ~1, an
instability develops in which the globals "slosh" from one side of the
parameter space to the other.  This is not good.  Reduce this parameter
to ~0.1 if you see this happening.  It is much better for the swarm to
"see" the same global potential for several time steps.

2. globalRange determines the degree to which global neighbourhoods
communicate with eachother.  When this parameter is set to 0, a particle
always picks the nearest global to follow.  When it is set > 0, a particle uses
an exponential probability distribution to choose its global.  For example,
when globalRange=1, the probability of picking the 2nd closest global is
aprroximately 1/e times the probability of picking the nearest one.  It
is very difficult to maintain multiple distinct swarms when this
parameter is > 0.
