## Mitochondrial Isolation
Homoginate was prepared from CD1 mouse cortical brain tissue. The white matter was removed from the cortical tissue,
which was homogenized using 500 uL of mitochondrial isolation buffer. The homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 800 G 
for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 8000 G for 15 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. 
The pellet was resuspended and then centrifuged again at 8000 G for 15 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The pellet, containing
isolated mitochondria, was resuspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer. A Bradford protein assay was performed to 
determine the protein concentration of the homogenate. 

##Oxygraph
The oxygraph was calibrated using 2 ml of Budapest buffer at 37 degrees Celsius. 300 ug of cortical homogenate protein was added to each well. 20 ul of 1M sodium pyruvate was added, resulting in a final concentration of 10 mM. 4 uL of 1M malate was added for a final concentration of 2mM. 8 uL of 0.5 M ADP was added for a final concentration of 2mM. 2 uL of 1mM oligomycin was added for a final concentration of 1uM. 10 uL of 100 uM FCCP was added for a final concentration of 0.5 uM. 2 uL of 1mM rotenone were added for a final concentration of 1uM. 2uL of 1mM antimycin A were added for a final concentration of 1uM.
