function SSATestMultiSimsStDev
tic
%{
Programmed by: Ella Thomson
Tracks the changes in amounts of three chemical reactants involved in
three chemical reactions. The reactions occur at randomly distributed
times. The program plots the quantities of all three substances vs time.
It produces two plots; one figure with each substance on its own plot,
and one figure with all three substances on the same plot.
